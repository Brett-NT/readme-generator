# README Generator

This project is intended to create a README page for any project by answering a few prompts in your console. You will be asked for your Github ID, the name of your project, a description of your project, any installation instructions, usage information, additional contributors, test instructions, which license you would like to attach to the project, and an email address. Once all prompts have been answered, the program will take your responses and produce a readme page that organizes your information into a professional readme page with an interactive table of contents.
