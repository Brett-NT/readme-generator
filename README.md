# README Generator

This project is designed to create a readme page for the user after responding to several prompts. The user will be asked for their github name, the name of their project, a description of their project, installation instructions, usage information, additional contributors, test instructions, licenses used, and an email address. Once all info has been submitted, a new .md file will be generated with the received data organized into an interactive taqble of contents.
